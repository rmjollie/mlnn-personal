The Raven
By Edgar Allan Poe
Once Upon A Midnight Dreary, While I Pondered, Weak And Weary,
Over Many A Quaint And Curious Volume Of Forgotten Lore
While I Nodded, Nearly Napping, Suddenly There Came A Tapping,
As Of Some One Gently Rapping, Rapping At My Chamber Door.
Tis Some Visitor, I Muttered, Tapping At My Chamber Door
Only This And Nothing More.
